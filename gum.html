<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<h3>Bubble Gum Draw is about emulating the famous Gum Wall in Seattle, WA. As many can not currently travel and are
eager to soon, this website is meant to reimagine a new way of experiencing this site. You can draw anything you like in any shade
or color, and imagine what you would do with the bubble gum if you had the chance. This website is meant to reimagine a real site far away.
Everytime you click the mouse to draw, a "pop" sound happens to mimic the sound of popping some bubble gum. The user is encouraged to listen
to the Mood Booster playlist that is linked on the top menu. The hope for this work is that the user is able to take part in a simple and fun
activity that emulates an experience from another place.
